;Your friend Joe is always whining about Lisps using the prefix notation for math. Show him how you could easily write a function that does math using the infix notation. Is your favorite language that flexible, Joe? Write a function that accepts a variable length mathematical expression consisting of numbers and the operations +, -, *, and /. Assume a simple calculator that does not do precedence and instead just calculates left to right.

(fn [x & xs]
  (reduce #((first %2) %1 (last %2)) x (partition 2 2 xs)))
